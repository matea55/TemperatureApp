TemperatureApp

- For starting application it is needed to clone the repository and start the application from Visual Studio, Swagger provides REST interface.
  
- Due to constant crashing from a lot of data, temperature data is reduced to few hundred lines, if needed "measurements.txt" can be replaced with another one with the same name and new data will be automatically recalculated and cached when calling any API
